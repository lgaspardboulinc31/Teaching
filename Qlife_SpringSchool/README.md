# Qlife Spring School - "Cell Dynamics in Developmental Systems"

Recent technological developments in sequencing, imaging and image analysis have granted access to unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution of gene expression, cell dynamics and morphological features.
The Qlife program in Quantitative Biology of the PSL University organizes a spring school that will cover these emerging approaches through a series of lectures and digital workshops, using datasets from Drosophila, ascidians and mammals. Dynamic, quantitative analysis of tissue development will be performed through the combination of image analysis (deep learning-based segmentation, cell tracking, registration) with multiscale analysis of forces and modeling. These data will be integrated with the output of single cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses to provide an unprecedented combined view of cell location, morphology, interactions, migration, expression pattern and fate.
